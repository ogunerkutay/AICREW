# AICrew Project

## Overview

**AICrew** is a project that combines different Python tools and libraries to mimic a software development team using AI. It's like putting together pieces of a puzzle. In AICrew, each AI agent acts as a member of a software team â€“ there's one for backend development, another for DevOps, and one for database management, among others. These AI agents work together to simulate building a mobile game. This project is just an example of how you can use these tools together.

## Installation

Before running AICrew, ensure you have the required libraries installed. Run the following commands to install necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
pip install gitpython
pip install langchain
pip install langchain-community
pip install langchain_google_genai
pip install faiss-gpu
pip install wikipedia
pip install crewai
```

## Usage

To use AICrew, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Run the Jupyter Notebook to start the simulation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ogunerkutay/AICrew.git
cd AICrew
jupyter notebook AICrew.ipynb
```

## Components

**AICrew** consists of several components:

- **Environment Setup:** Initialize the environment and import necessary libraries.
- **Configuration and Initialization:** Set up LangChain and Google Generative AI embeddings.
- **Document Processing:** Functions for loading and processing documents.
- **RetrievalQA Chain:** Set up a retrieval-based question-answering chain.
- **Tools Initialization:** Initialize various tools for agents, including Wikipedia Query, File Management, and custom tools for specific functions.
- **Agents and Crew Initialization:** Define roles for each agent in the software development process.
- **Execution and Results Handling:** Kick off the crew and handle results of the development process.
